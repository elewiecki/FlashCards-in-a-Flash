Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over a cloth
covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive,
causing the person to experience the sensation of drowning. In the most
common method of waterboarding, the captive's face is covered with
cloth or some other thin material and immobilized on their back at an
incline of 10 to 20 degrees.!"1I2] Torturers pour water onto the face over
the breathing passages, causing an almost immediate gag reflex and
creating a drowning sensation for the captive.!II415] Normally, water is
poured intermittently to prevent death. However, if the water is poured
uninterruptedly it will lead to death by asphyxia, also called dry drowning.
Waterboarding can cause extreme pain, damage to lungs, brain damage
from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones
due to struggling against restraints, and lasting psychological damage.!©1

for years.!”] The term "water board torture" appeared in press reports as
early as 1976.6
