The Nature of Science Biology@@@fascinating and important subject, because it dramatically affects our daily lives and our futures
Science@@@way of viewing the world that focuses on objective information, putting that information to work to build understanding
After making careful observations concerning a particular area of science, scientists construct a hypothesis, which@@@suggested explanation that accounts for those observations
A hypothesis@@@proposition that might be true
A “theory”@@@proposed explanation for some natural phenomenon, often based on some general principle
Modern evolutionary theory@@@complex body of ideas whose importance spreads far beyond explaining evolution; its ramifications permeate all areas of biology, and it provides the conceptual framework that unifies biology as a science
---------- blah@@@good boy
blah@@@very good boy
This sort of analysis of specific cases using general principles@@@example of deductive reasoning
The hypothesis that evolution has occurred@@@accepted scientific fact; it is supported by overwhelming evidence
A hypothesis that a successful scientist tests is not just any hypothesis; rather, it@@@educated guess or a hunch, in which the scientist integrates all that he or she knows and allows his or her imagination full play, in an attempt to get a sense of what might be true (see Box: How Biologists Do Their Work)
Eratosthenes had heard that it@@@50-day camel trip from Alexandria to Syene
They reason in two ways@@@deductively and inductively
From a host of simple, specific observations like this, Newton inferred a general principle@@@all objects fall toward the center of the earth
3 Deductive reasoning@@@How Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the earth using deductive reasoning
This is done by carrying out two experiments in parallel@@@in the first experiment, one variable is altered in a specific way to test a particular hypothesis; in the second experiment, called the control experiment, that variable is left unaltered
The hypothesis made a clear prediction@@@that the sun would bend the path of light passing by it
A hypothesis that a successful scientist tests is not just any hypothesis; rather, it is an educated guess or a hunch, in which the scientist integrates all that he or she knows and allows his or her imagination full play, in an attempt to get a sense of what might be true (see Box@@@How Biologists Do Their Work)
Although some, such as Science and Nature, are devoted to a wide range of scientific disciplines, most are extremely specialized@@@Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton, Glycoconjugate Journal, Mutation Research, and Synapse are just a few examples
Some scientists perform what@@@basic research, which is intended to extend the boundaries of what we know
angle a = 1 50 of a circle@@@the distance between the obelisk (in Alexandria) and the well (in Syene) must equal 1 50 of the circumference of the earth
2200@@@years ago, the Greek Eratosthenes used deductive reasoning to accurately estimate the circumference of the earth
1600@@@s in Europe, when Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and others began to use the results of particular experiments to infer general principles about how the world operates
