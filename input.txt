The Nature of Science
Biology is a fascinating and important subject, because it
dramatically affects our daily lives and our futures. Many
biologists are working on problems that critically affect our
lives, such as the world’s rapidly expanding population and
diseases like cancer and AIDS. The knowledge these biologists gain will be fundamental to our ability to manage the
world’s resources in a suitable manner, to prevent or cure
diseases, and to improve the quality of our lives and those
of our children and grandchildren.
Biology is one of the most successful of the “natural sciences,” explaining what our world is like. To understand
biology, you must first understand the nature of science.
The basic tool a scientist uses is thought. To understand
the nature of science, it is useful to focus for a moment on
how scientists think. They reason in two ways: deductively
and inductively.
Deductive Reasoning
Deductive reasoning applies general principles to predict
specific results. Over 2200 years ago, the Greek Eratosthenes used deductive reasoning to accurately estimate
the circumference of the earth. At high noon on the longest
day of the year, when the sun’s rays hit the bottom of a
deep well in the city of Syene, Egypt, Eratosthenes measured the length of the shadow cast by a tall obelisk in Alexandria, about 800 kilometers to the north. Because he
knew the distance between the two cities and the height of
the obelisk, he was able to employ the principles of Euclidean geometry to correctly deduce the circumference of the
earth (figure 1.3). This sort of analysis of specific cases using general principles is an example of deductive reasoning.
It is the reasoning of mathematics and philosophy and is
used to test the validity of general ideas in all branches of
knowledge. General principles are constructed and then
used as the basis for examining specific cases.
Inductive Reasoning
Inductive reasoning uses specific observations to construct
general scientific principles. Webster’s Dictionary defines science as systematized knowledge derived from observation
and experiment carried on to determine the principles underlying what is being studied. In other words, a scientist
determines principles from observations, discovering general principles by careful examination of specific cases. Inductive reasoning first became important to science in the
1600s in Europe, when Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and
