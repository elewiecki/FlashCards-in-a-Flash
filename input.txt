The Nature of Science

Biology is a fascinating and important subject, because it
dramatically affects our daily lives and our futures. Many
biologists are working on problems that critically affect our
lives, such as the world’s rapidly expanding population and
diseases like cancer and AIDS. The knowledge these biolo-
gists gain will be fundamental to our ability to manage the
world’s resources in a suitable manner, to prevent or cure
diseases, and to improve the quality of our lives and those
of our children and grandchildren.

Biology is one of the most successful of the “natural sci-
ences,” explaining what our world is like. To understand
biology, you must first understand the nature of science.
‘The basic tool a scientist uses is thought. To understand
the nature of science, itis useful to focus for a moment on.
how scientists think. They reason in two ways: deductively
and inductively.

day when sunlight shone straight down a deep well t Syene in
Egypt, Erstosthencs measured the length of the shadow cast by a
tall obelisk inthe city of Alexandria, abou $00 kilometers away.

tosthenes used deductive reasoning to accurately estimate
the circumference of the earth. Ar high noon on the longest
day of the year, when the sun’s rays hit the bottom of a
deep well in the city of Syene, Egypt, Eratosthenes mea-
sured the length of the shadow cast by a tall obelisk in Al-
exandria, about 800 kilometers to the north. Because he

used as the basis for examining specific cases.
